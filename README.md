I am an aspiring computer scientist who enjoys to programming and writing software that others could use. When I began pursuing computer science, I was hooked on landing a career as a penetration tester, so cybersecurity was my first love. Now, I would like to pursue a career where I can have a blend of my two interests: sopftware development and cybersecurity.

In my free time, I pursue opportunities for me to develop the skills needed for this kind of career, such as developing software applications and learning the principles of reverse engineering malware. 

## Where it all started

Unlike most, I didn't begin programming at an early age, nor was I always interested in computers. I believe I landed in the world of computer science by sheer luck. 

When I graduated high school, I began working at my local Sheriff's Office hoping to make connections for a career in law enforcement. I eventually began helping the IT unit with basic data entry, and this is where I was introduced to computer science.
