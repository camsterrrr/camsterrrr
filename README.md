# About Me

By day, I work as a Senior IT Analyst and Web Administrator for the Monterey County Sheriff's Office, where I manage mission-critical systems, build secure web infrastructure, and support law enforcement operations through reliable, responsive IT. By night, I'm a Computer Engineering graduate student at UC Santa Cruz with a passion for software development, cybersecurity, and public service technology.

My journey into tech began with a love for cybersecurity—penetration testing was my original goal—and that foundation continues to shape how I build and secure systems today. Whether I'm writing automation scripts, reverse-engineering malware for fun, or deploying infrastructure at scale, I enjoy creating practical solutions that others can rely on.

I use this space to share personal projects, small tools, and experiments that reflect my ongoing growth as a developer and security-minded engineer.
